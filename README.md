# Network-Based App Development Projects

This repository is a collection of web application projects primarily focused on two domains:

1. **Manga Collectors Platform (Multiple Iterations):**
   - A web application series that provides a platform for manga collectors to browse, sell, and view detailed information about manga items.
   - Progresses from static HTML/CSS sites to dynamic, full-stack applications using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.
   - Later iterations add user account management, dashboards, CRUD operations for manga listings, and features like authentication, session handling, and flash messages.

2. **Jibber Jabber Story Sharing Platform (Modules 4â€“9):**
   - A stepwise development of a story sharing app, "Jibber Jabber," evolving from a basic CRUD platform to a fully featured application with user authentication, authorization, and persistent storage using MongoDB and Mongoose.
   - Built with Express.js, EJS templating, and various middleware for session management, flash messaging, and error handling.
   - Each module adds new features, refactors the architecture (models, controllers, routes), and enhances the user experience.

**Additional Modules:**
- Examples demonstrating Node.js module systems and user management basics with Mongoose, focusing on modular code, password hashing, and CRUD operations.

**Core Technologies:**
- Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB (with Mongoose), session and authentication middleware, HTML/CSS, and modular JavaScript.

**Purpose:**
The repository serves as a learning and development portfolio for network-based app development, showcasing progressive enhancements in full-stack application design, user management, and dynamic web features.
