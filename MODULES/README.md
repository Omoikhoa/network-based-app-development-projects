# MODULES

This project demonstrates a basic Node.js module system. It includes:

- **main.js:**  
  Imports the calculation module and uses its exported functions. It logs the module object and calls the `add` function.

- **calculation.js:**  
  Defines arithmetic functions. Currently, only the `add` function is active, while the subtraction operation is commented out. This file shows how to export functions using `module.exports`.

## How to Use

1. Run the application with `node main.js`.
2. Observe the console output to see the results of calling the `add` function.

Explore the code to understand how modules are defined and imported in Node.js.
